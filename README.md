# Hello-World
Something to get started with.
I'm a Science Education student in Maynooth University.
At the end of my time there I will be teaching Computer Science and Maths in secondary school.
I'm a mature student (old) who used to teach FETAC levels in IT but never coded before I went into my first year in Maynooth.
This last year I was President of the Computer Science Society, loved every minute of that!
Hopefully this will give me a chance to just practice coding for me, without it being about assignments.
